# Front-end Development Course - Session 3
In this session, we implemented the homepage of an online store using HTML and CSS. We utilized semantic HTML tags to structure the page and make it more accessible. Additionally, we used Flaticon, a site for downloading free icons, to enhance the design of our page.

## Project Details
* Our project focused on creating a visually appealing homepage for an online store. We used CSS to style the various elements on the page, including the header, navigation bar, and product categories. We also used Flaticon icons to add visual interest to the page and make it easier for users to understand the products being offered.

## Topics Covered
In this session, we covered the following topics:
* Semantic HTML tags
* Styling with CSS
* Working with icons using Flaticon
* Conclusion

## Hint
* It is possible that due to non-responsive designs in monitors with different dimensions than mine, the layout may have some issues.


We hope you enjoyed this session and learned valuable skills in HTML and CSS. Please continue to practice and explore these topics on your own, and feel free to reach out to us with any questions or feedback. Thank you for attending this session.
